# COUNTER
Have you ever had to keep track of different types of things (sweets, stocks, standards of the Western Roman Empire) in an inventory, and how many of each there were? Ever wanted a simple program to help you tally each, painfully and manually, as you counted?

Was it also the 1960s?

## Usage
Compile and launch to be greeted with an excellent user interface brought to you by the forefront in mainframe technology. Then enter the name of any item you wish to add to the tally. The first time, it will create a new entry for that object. After that, entering the name of that item again will increase its tally count by 1. Magic! Be careful to name it exactly, since we don't have fuzzy searches (what is this, the 2020s?). Among other commands, you can type "DISPLAY" to get a summary of the tally so far.

## No, but seriously
I made this after having to tally a bunch of counts of different items in excel while physically sorting through them on my desk (let's say different kinds of fruits):
- Find cell with name "orange"
- Click on cell next to it
- Clear existing number
- Type out that existing number + 1
- Next object

Mouse to keyboard to mouse -- I wanted something that would let me do it even more mindlessly. With this, it was just
- Type "orange"
- Next object

Perfect!
